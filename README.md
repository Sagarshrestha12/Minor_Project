## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
1 Main Objective
- To design and develop a system for number recognition of result papers
  using machine learning and generate the mark sheet of students in pdf
  format.<br>
- To capture the numeric characters.
- To implement a Convolution Neural network to recognize numerals in
images.
- To train the system using the Mnist dataset.
- To store the detected data (symbol number and marks) into the database and
create the mark sheet.
## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
You can get report of my project in finalproject.pdf file.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
